// Welcome to a new tutorial which will help you to learn the basic and a little bit of advanced knowldege for C++. 
// All you need is G++ which can be downloaded from the internet!

// A c++ file is made using the extension '.cpp'.
// Let's write a simple and basic code 
// In this language, you need to import files in order to use some of the functionalities.


// Here we included 'iostream' which is used for taking input and output from the user. This type of files are called header files. 
// Syntax : #include <header_file>
#include <iostream>       

// Here we create a program and when the program is ran, a software (.exe) is created in the same folder. So, it is recommended to use 'CODE RUNNER' extension in VS code.
// The entry of code in C++ starts from 'main' so every code should be written like this inside the curly brackets.
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hey there";       // 'cout' is used for showing output and every line should end with a semi-colon. You need to use '<<' to show what output should be given.
    // Syntax - std::cout << "string_here";
}

// See you in the next chapter!
